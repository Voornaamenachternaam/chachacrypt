# - curl and jq available (script will attempt to install jq if missing on Debian-based runners)

You are an expert Go developer. I have recently updated a ${REFACTOR_TYPE} which may have introduced breaking changes in the following file: ${file}.

Your task is to provide a complete, ready-to-write Go source file that resolves compilation errors, breaking changes, and deprecated function calls introduced by the ${REFACTOR_TYPE} change while preserving original functionality and intent. Provide idiomatic, modern Go. Do not include explanations â€” only a single code block containing the complete file contents (no surrounding commentary). If no changes are required, return the original file contents verbatim.

File path: ${file}

Code to refactor:
\`\`\`go
${file_content}
\`\`\`
